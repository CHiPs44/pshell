A tiny Raspberry Pico shell with flash file system, Vi, and C compiler.

[busybox]: https://www.busybox.net
[amacc compiler]: https://github.com/jserv/amacc.git
[c4 virtual machine]: https://github.com/rswier/c4.git
[Squint]: https://github.com/HPCguy/Squint.git
[list of implemented functions]: FUNCTIONS.md
[What's new]: WHATSNEW.md

Credit where credit is due...

- The vi code is ported from the [BusyBox] source code.
- The compiler code is a remix of the [amacc compiler] parser generator
and the [c4 virtual machine]. Many important amacc enhancements such as
floating point, array, struct and type checking support were taken fom
the [Squint] project.

[What's new] in pshell

About the compiler, brieflyâ€¦

- Data types: integer, float, char and pointer.
- Aggregate types: single dimension array, struct and union.
- Flow control: for, while, if then else, break, continue goto.
- Memory, math and SDK functions. ([list of implemented functions])

Building from source.

Edit the root folder CMakeLists.tx file to pick a console device, then:

```
# NOTE: Requires sdk 1.3 or later
git clone https://github.com/lurk101/pshell.git
cd pshell
git submodule update --init
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
Starting with version 1.0.4 all development will occur on the dev branch. To build it:
```
git checkout dev
```

Example (somewhat dated) log.
